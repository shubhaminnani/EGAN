# EGAN : Generative Adversarial Network for Skin Lesion Segmentation

Automatic lesion segmentation is a critical computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tool vital in ensuring effective treatment. Computer-aided diagnosis of such skin cancer on dermoscopic images can significantly reduce the cliniciansâ€™ workload and improve diagnostic accuracy. This paper proposes an adversarial learning-based segmentation framework that leverages the adversarial learning-based framework (EGAN) for skin lesion segmentation. Specifically, this framework integrates two modules: The segmentation module and the discriminator module.
